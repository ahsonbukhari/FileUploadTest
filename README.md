# FileUploadTest
Sample API for handling file uploads

Here are some of the things I would do given proper time to get it PRD Ready...

1- Implement Dependency Injection
2- Implement the domain layer properly with DB Connection management and Transaction handling
3- Introduce audit tracking or Logging
4- Apply error handling and logging of all errors
5- Apply diagnostics such as Application Insights
6- Finish up the Test project for Domain and add another one for the API project as well...
7- And of course finsih up all the required functionality given proper time.
